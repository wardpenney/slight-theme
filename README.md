# Shopify Theme with SASS and Compass

* Clone this repo
	* `git clone https://github.com/wardpenney/shopify-theme-sass.git MY_NEW_THEME_NAME`
	* `cd MY_NEW_THEME_NAME`
	* `rm -Rf .git`
	* `git init`
	* Make a commit and push to your new project repo
* Get a new theme folder going. I Suggest the [Shopify Skeleton Theme](https://github.com/shopify/skeleton-theme)
	* Navigate to a temporary folder
	* `git clone https://github.com/shopify/skeleton-theme.git MY_NEW_THEME_NAME`
	* `zip -r MY_NEW_THEME_NAME.zip MY_NEW_THEME_NAME`
	* Upload that zipfile to Shopify as a new theme
* Download the [Shopify Theme Editor](https://apps.shopify.com/desktop-theme-editor)
	* Use that tool to point to your new repository `MY_NEW_THEME_NAME/` to sync to the theme you just uploaded.
	* Commit those files
	* Preview and edit away!
* Update the Compass settings in config.rb to point to the correct subfolder generated by the Shopify Theme Editor
	* The folder will be MY_NEW_THEME_NAME-#########. The integer is the unique Shopify Theme ID
